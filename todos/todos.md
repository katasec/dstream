## Transient vs. Persistent Errors
Current State: The system doesn't clearly distinguish between transient errors (like network timeouts) and persistent errors (like schema mismatches).

### Design Ideas:

Implement an error classification system that categorizes errors as transient or persistent
For transient errors, implement exponential backoff retry logic
For persistent errors, fail fast and provide clear error messages for troubleshooting

## Batch Processing Resilience
Current State: If a batch fails partway through processing, there's potential for partial updates.

### Design Ideas:

Implement a two-phase commit pattern where changes are staged before being committed
Track batch processing state in a separate table to allow for resuming after failures
Consider implementing compensating transactions for rollback scenarios


## Connection Management
Current State: Database connection failures might not be properly handled in all scenarios.

### Design Ideas:

Implement connection pooling with health checks
Add circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures when the database is under stress
Implement automatic reconnection logic with configurable retry policies

## Error Observability
Current State: Error logging is improved but could benefit from more structured error reporting.

### Design Ideas:

Enhance logging with correlation IDs to track errors across components
Implement metrics collection for error rates and types
Create a dashboard for monitoring error patterns and trends
Add alerting for critical error conditions

## Graceful Degradation
Current State: The system might completely fail if certain components are unavailable.

### Design Ideas:

Implement feature flags to disable problematic components without taking down the entire system
Design fallback mechanisms for critical paths
Add configurable timeout settings for all external dependencies

## Error Recovery Workflows
Current State: Recovery from serious errors often requires manual intervention.

Design Ideas:

Design self-healing mechanisms for common failure scenarios
Implement a recovery workflow system that can be triggered automatically or manually
Create tools for operators to safely replay failed batches

## Validation and Constraints
Current State: Input validation might not catch all edge cases before they cause errors.

### Design Ideas:

Implement schema validation at multiple levels (not just database constraints)
Add pre-condition checks before critical operations
Design better error messages that suggest remediation steps

## Resource Management
Current State: Resource leaks might occur during error conditions.

### Design Ideas:

Ensure proper resource cleanup in all error paths using defer statements
Implement resource usage monitoring and alerting
Add circuit breakers for resource-intensive operations
Implementation Priority
If you decide to implement these improvements, I would suggest prioritizing:

Transient vs. Persistent error handling (biggest impact on reliability)
Error observability (helps diagnose issues faster)
Batch processing resilience (prevents data inconsistency)
Would you like to discuss any of these areas in more detail?


## CDC Monitoring System: Error Handling Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Transient vs. Persistent Error Handling
- Create an ErrorType enum (Transient, Persistent, Unknown)
- Implement a custom error wrapper that includes error type classification
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff for transient errors
- Create helper functions to classify common errors (DB timeouts, connection issues, etc.)
- Update error returns in BatchSizer to use the new error types
- Add maximum retry configuration settings

### Phase 2: Error Observability
- Enhance logger to include correlation IDs for tracking request flows
- Add structured error fields (component, operation, error_type)
- Implement error metrics collection (error_count, error_type, component)
- Create Prometheus/Grafana dashboards for error monitoring
- Set up alerting for critical error thresholds
- Add context propagation to ensure errors maintain their trace context

### Phase 3: Batch Processing Resilience
- Create a batch state tracking table in the database
- Implement batch checkpointing to record progress
- Add transaction support for atomic batch operations
- Create a recovery mechanism for failed batches
- Implement idempotent processing to prevent duplicate processing
- Add batch validation before processing starts

### Phase 4: Connection Management
- Implement connection pooling with health checks
- Add circuit breaker pattern for database operations
- Create connection retry policies with configurable parameters
- Add connection timeout configurations
- Implement graceful connection closing during shutdown

### Phase 5: Graceful Degradation
- Add feature flags for component-level disabling
